Using ipconfig command in command prompt we can get the IP address of our devices.
In my case following is the result:
1) IP Address: 192.168.16.101
2) Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
3) Network Address: 192.168.16.0
4) Broadcast Address: 192.168.16.255

Here Network address is calculated by bitwise & operation between binary IP Address and binary subnet mask.
Similarly broadcast Address is calculated by bitwise OR operation between the binary network address and the binary inverted subnet mask.

Here the number of host bit is number of 0s in binary subnet mask which is 8 in my case.
Therefore, the total number of IP addresses = 2^8=256.
Since, we have to allocate one IP address for network address and another for broadcast address. Therefore, Number of usable 
IP addresses= 256-2= 254= number of end devices supported by my network.

Hence, total number of end devices supported by my network is 254.
