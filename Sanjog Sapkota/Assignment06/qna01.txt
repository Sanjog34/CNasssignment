 How long is IPv6 header?What are the different fields?What are the purpose of different header fields?

The IPv6 header is fixed at 40 bytes in length. 
Here are the fields in the IPv6 header along with their purposes:

Version (4 bits)
Purpose: Indicates the IP version. For IPv6, this value is always 6.

Traffic Class (8 bits)
Purpose: Used for packet classification and prioritization, similar to the DSCP field in IPv4.
 It allows for differentiated services and quality of service (QoS).

Flow Label (20 bits)
Purpose: Used to identify packets that belong to the same flow.
 It allows routers to identify and handle flows of packets in a consistent manner, improving the efficiency of packet forwarding.

Payload Length (16 bits)
Purpose: Indicates the length of the payload (the data following the header) in bytes.
 It does not include the length of the IPv6 header itself.

Next Header (8 bits)
Purpose: Identifies the type of header immediately following the IPv6 header.
 This can indicate various extension headers or the upper-layer protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).

Hop Limit (8 bits)
Purpose: Specifies the maximum number of hops (routers) that the packet can traverse.
 This is similar to the TTL field in IPv4. Each router that forwards the packet decrements this value by one.
  If the Hop Limit reaches zero, the packet is discarded.

Source Address (128 bits)
Purpose: Contains the IPv6 address of the originator of the packet.

Destination Address (128 bits)
Purpose: Contains the IPv6 address of the intended recipient of the packet.
