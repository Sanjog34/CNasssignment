 Q)  What is the value of each of the header fields ? Explain why the value is what it is .

--> a. Version(4 bits) ,  value =4.means that the ipversion is 4 i.e. IPv4.

--> b. Header Length <IHL> (4 bits) ,Indicates the number of 32-bit words in the header.
       value = 5 means the header is 20 bytes long (5 * 4 bytes).

--> c. DSCP (6 bits) ,Value= 0x00 .  Value 0x00  indicates  a DSCP value which is associated with 
       the Expedited Forwarding (EF) Per-Hop Behavior.

--> d. ECN (2 bits) , Value =00 , This value indicates that the packet is not using ECN.
       It is not ECN-capable, and any network devices should not set or interpret ECN-related bits 
	   for this packet.

--> e. Total Length (2 bytes) , Value =69 , This value indicates that the entire packet, including the header
       and data is 169 bytes long .

--> f. Identification (2 bytes), Value =0x7a8d, This value indicates that the identification value of the 
       packet is 31373 . 

--> g. Flags (3 bits) , Value=0x0, The value 0x0 identifies that the packet may be fragmented if necessary.

--> h. Fragment Offset( 13 bits) , Value = 0, Indicates where in the datagram this fragment belongs , 0 means 
       not fragmented. 

--> i. TTL <Time to live> (1 byte) , Value=64 , Indicates it can pass through 64 routers before getting 
       discarded.

--> j. Protocol (1 byte) , Value : UDP( 17) , It means User Datagram Protocal (UDP) is being used in the data 
       portion of the IP packet. 

--> k. Header Checksum (2 bytes) , value : 0x7ca1, It indicates whether the sent packets and recieved packets 
       are same or not , if not same then some data is lost.

--> l. Source Address (4 bytes) , value: 192.168.1.40, It indiates the ip address of the sender which means
       the packets is sent from the above ip address

--> m. Destination Address (4 bytes), value: 192.168.1.74, It indicates the ip address of the receiver which 
       means our ip address is 192.168.1.1.
