 Q)  What is the value of each of the header fields ? Explain why the value is what it is .
a. Version (4 bits)
Value = 4
This means the IP version is 4, indicating that the packet is using IPv4.

b. Header Length (IHL) (4 bits)
Value = 5
This indicates the number of 32-bit words in the header. A value of 5 means the header is 20 bytes long (5 * 4 bytes).

c. DSCP (6 bits)
Value = 0x00
The value 0x00 indicates a DSCP value which is associated with the default forwarding behavior. DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) is used for packet classification.

d. ECN (2 bits)
Value = 00
This value indicates that the packet is not using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). It is not ECN-capable, and any network devices should not set or interpret ECN-related bits for this packet.

e. Total Length (2 bytes)
Value = 169
This value indicates that the entire packet, including the header and data, is 169 bytes long.

f. Identification (2 bytes)
Value = 0x7a8d
This value indicates that the identification value of the packet is 31373 (in decimal). This is used for identifying fragments of the original packet.

g. Flags (3 bits)
Value = 0x0
The value 0x0 identifies that the packet may be fragmented if necessary. This means:
Reserved bit: 0
Don't Fragment (DF) bit: 0
More Fragments (MF) bit: 0

h. Fragment Offset (13 bits)
Value = 0
This indicates where in the datagram this fragment belongs. A value of 0 means the packet is not fragmented.

i. TTL (Time to Live) (1 byte)
Value = 64
This indicates the packet can pass through 64 routers before being discarded. TTL is used to prevent packets from circulating indefinitely.

j. Protocol (1 byte)
Value = 17 (UDP)
This means the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is being used in the data portion of the IP packet.

k. Header Checksum (2 bytes)
Value = 0x7ca1
This checksum value is used to check the integrity of the header. It ensures that the header contents have not been corrupted during transmission.

l. Source Address (4 bytes)
Value = 192.168.1.40
This indicates the IP address of the sender. The packet is sent from the IP address 192.168.1.40.

m. Destination Address (4 bytes)
Value = 192.168.1.74
This indicates the IP address of the receiver. The packet is intended for the IP address 192.168.1.74.
