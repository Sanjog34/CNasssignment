Questions of first assignment and answers  are:
## 1. What is your?

- IP address:- 192.168.0.103
- Subnet Mask:-255.255.255.0
- Network Address:-192.168.0.0
- Broadcast Address:-192.168.0.255
- Default Gateway:- 192.168.0.1
## 2. How many end devices can your network support?
Ans: looking at my subnet mask, we found that there are 24 network bits and 8 host bits.
hence, my network can support ( 2^8-2) end devices.i.e. 254 end devices.
Here, 2 is subtracted because 192.168.0.0 is network address and 192.168.0.255 is broadcast
address. 

## 3. Simulate your Network on Packet Tracer.
